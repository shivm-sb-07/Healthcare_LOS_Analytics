A **Healthcare Length of Stay (LOS) Analytics** Power BI project typically focuses on analyzing patient admission and discharge data to optimize hospital operations, reduce costs, and improve patient care. Hereâ€™s a detailed specification:

---

### **1. Project Scope & Objectives**  
- **Analyze** patient **Length of Stay (LOS)** trends across departments.  
- Identify factors affecting LOS, such as diagnoses, treatment plans, and resource availability.  
- Reduce unnecessary extended stays and optimize bed utilization.  
- Improve discharge planning and patient flow.  

---

### **2. Data Sources & Databases**  
Common databases used:  
- **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** (e.g., Epic, Cerner, Meditech)  
- **Hospital Information Systems (HIS)**  
- **SQL Databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)  
- **Cloud Databases** (Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Azure SQL)  
- **FHIR/HL7 Data** for interoperability  
- **Excel/CSV Files** (for external datasets)  

---

### **3. Data Model & Schema**  
Key tables:  
- **Patient Data** (Patient_ID, Name, Age, Gender, Admission Date, Discharge Date)  
- **Admission Details** (Admission_ID, Department, Room No., Attending Physician)  
- **Diagnosis & Procedures** (ICD Codes, Treatment Plans, Surgery Details)  
- **Medication History** (Prescriptions, Dosages, Duration)  
- **Discharge Information** (Discharge Status, Follow-up Requirements)  

---

### **4. Key Metrics & KPIs**  
- **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)** = Total LOS / Total Discharges  
- **LOS by Department/Diagnosis**  
- **Readmission Rate (%)**  
- **Bed Occupancy Rate (%)**  
- **Discharge Efficiency (%)**  
- **Predicted LOS using ML/AI models**  

---

### **5. Power BI Features & Visualizations**  
- **Interactive Dashboards** with filters for Date, Department, and Diagnosis  
- **Drill-through Reports** (Detailed patient journey analysis)  
- **Trend Analysis** (LOS trends over time)  
- **Heatmaps** (High LOS areas in hospital departments)  
- **Predictive Analytics** (Using Python/R integration in Power BI)  

---

### **6. Advanced Features**  
- **DAX Formulas** for custom calculations  
- **Power Query** for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)  
- **RLS (Row-Level Security)** for role-based access  
- **Integration with AI models** for predictive analytics  
- **Automated Report Scheduling** (Power BI Service)
